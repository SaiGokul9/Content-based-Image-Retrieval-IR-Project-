# Content-based-Image-Retrieval-IR-Project-
• Developed a user-friendly website that enables users to retrieve a user-defined number of relevant images for a query image
• Employed InceptionResNetV2 for feature extraction and utilized Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction
• Enhanced precision of the model by implementing image orientation correction for accurate retrieval of rotated query images
• Used a Google Vision-based Transformer, trained on Microsoft COCO dataset, to determine query image's rotation angle
